It's really hard to keep up with open source machine learning. Since (almost) every new Python repo on GitHub is an ML repo, let's just list all the latest GitHub/HuggingFace Python repos in an easily readable format (i.e. HN-style).

This website is updated daily by pulling the 500 most starred repos from the past week from GitHub and HuggingFace as well as the top posts from /r/MachineLearning and /r/LocalLlama. It can be filtered by repos created in the past week, past 3 days, and past day.

## Development

I don't know next.js so this app was 99% written by GPT-4.

To run locally, first create a `.env.local` file with

```
SUPABASE_URL=...
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
```

Then start the app locally

```
vercel dev
```
